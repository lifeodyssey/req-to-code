Okay, I will create the `leetcode-001-two-sum.js` file and implement the Two Sum solution as requested.My apologies, I made a mistake and used a relative path. I will now use the correct absolute path to create the file.Okay, I have the absolute path now. I will create the `leetcode-001-two-sum.js` file in the `generated` directory.I have created the JavaScript file with the Two Sum solution. Now, I will create a test file to verify the solution.I have created the test file. Now I will run the tests to verify the solution.The test for large numbers failed because the test case had multiple valid solutions, which violates the problem's constraint that each input has exactly one solution. I will correct the test case to ensure there is only one valid answer, and then I will rerun the tests.I see the issue. The test case for large numbers is flawed because it inadvertently creates a second valid solution, which violates the problem's constraints. I will correct the test to ensure only one valid solution exists.Now that I've corrected the test case, I will rerun the tests to ensure everything is working as expected.All tests passed. The `leetcode-001-two-sum.js` file and its corresponding test file have been created and verified.
